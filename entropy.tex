\begin{abstract}
We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of
Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does
not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical
principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant.
The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs
its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity
statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum
of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any
entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic
variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on
constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that
constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution
$P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the
Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the
microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain
the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by
a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally. Recent experimental
work validates this framework: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy
transitions, allowing systems to produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single
thermal reservoir. With both theoretical and experimental barriers overcome, practical
devices based on constraint-reshaped entropy distributions become feasible, with profound
implications for energy generation and the long-term sustainability of civilization.

\section{Introduction}

The ``Second Law'' is often presented in two forms.
\emph{Strict (deterministic) form}: for an isolated system, entropy does not
decrease along \emph{every} trajectory, i.e. $S(t+\delta t)\ge S(t)$ for all $t$
and all microstates (or $\mathrm{d}S/\mathrm{d}t\ge 0$ wherever defined).
\emph{Statistical form}: for an appropriate ensemble or limit, entropy increase is
``overwhelmingly probable'' or the ensemble-average entropy change is nonnegative.

This paper has one scope: we address these statements only insofar as they are
claimed to be \emph{universal} consequences of time-reversal invariant microscopic
physics. We show that such universal monotonicity claims are logically incompatible
with time-reversal symmetry. The consistent replacement is not to end thermodynamics,
but to replace ``entropy has a direction'' with: \textbf{entropy has no direction;
it is described by a probability distribution}. Moreover, \textbf{constraints and
boundary conditions reshape this distribution}. The present theoretical exploration was motivated by the author's earlier
simulation work, which showed that geometry can challenge
conventional entropy regimes and induce regime-dependent rectification in
nanofluidic cascades~\cite{peng2026geometrychallengesentropyregimedependentrectification}.
We then prove from first principles that constraints reshape the long-time entropy
distribution, and we discuss recent experimental work that validates this framework.

\section{Preliminaries and assumptions}
\label{sec:prelim}

\subsection{Microscopic dynamics and time reversal}

Let $\Gamma(t)$ denote the phase-space microstate of an isolated system evolving
under time-reversal invariant microscopic dynamics (Hamiltonian dynamics being the
canonical example). Let $\mathcal{T}$ denote time reversal, which (for classical
mechanics) acts by reversing momenta while leaving positions unchanged.

Time-reversal invariance means: if $\Gamma_A(t)$ is a solution, then
$\Gamma_B(t):=\mathcal{T}\Gamma_A(2t_0-t)$ is also a solution. In particular, the
forward-time evolution of the mirror state $\Gamma_B(t_0)=\mathcal{T}\Gamma_A(t_0)$
replays the past of $\Gamma_A$ in reverse.

\subsection{Entropy as a coarse-grained state function}

We use Boltzmann (coarse-grained) entropy: fix a time-reversal symmetric
coarse-graining (partition) of phase space into macrostates (cells) $\{C_m\}$.
Assign to any $\Gamma\in C_m$ an instantaneous entropy $S(\Gamma)=S_m$.

For mathematical cleanliness (finite volumes), we adopt the energy-shell form used
in statistical mechanics: at fixed energy $E$ define the accessible macrostate
volume $W_m^{(E)}$ on the energy shell and set $S_m^{(E)}=k_B\ln(W_m^{(E)}/W_0)$,
with an arbitrary reference volume $W_0$ (shifting entropy by a constant does not
affect any conclusions). This is the same entropy notion used below to derive
$P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$.

We assume the coarse-graining is time-reversal symmetric, so $S(\mathcal{T}\Gamma)=S(\Gamma)$.

\subsection{Continuity (minimal regularity)}
\label{sec:continuity}

The mirror-state paradox below is clearest when $S(t):=S(\Gamma(t))$ is continuous
in time along trajectories (standard for smooth coarse-graining, or for coarse
variables defining macrostates). This is the only regularity used to turn ``local
minimum everywhere'' into ``constant everywhere''.

\paragraph{Remark (discrete coarse-graining).}
If the coarse-graining is strictly discrete, then $S(t)$ may be piecewise constant
with jumps. The paradox still goes through for a universal monotonicity claim that
is asserted for \emph{arbitrarily small} $\delta t>0$: Eq.~\eqref{eq:two_sided_min}
forces $S(t_0)$ to be simultaneously a right- and left-minimum at every $t_0$,
which rules out any jump up or down and again implies that $S(t)$ is constant.

\subsection{What is meant by $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$}
\label{sec:Pinf_meaning}

In the second part of the paper, $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ denotes a \emph{long-time}
entropy distribution induced by an invariant measure. Two standard routes make
this precise:
(i) assume the dynamics are ergodic/mixing on the relevant invariant set so that
time averages (and long-time distributions) are independent of the initial
microstate up to measure-zero exceptions; or
(ii) consider an ensemble whose initial microstates are drawn from the invariant
measure (microcanonical or canonical), in which case $P_{\infty}$ is immediate.
Our formulas below are statements about the invariant measures themselves and the
entropy distributions induced by them; the above routes justify interpreting these
as long-time distributions.

\section{The mirror-state paradox}
\label{sec:paradox}

\subsection{Strict (trajectory-wise) monotonicity is impossible as a universal law}

\textbf{Claim.} A universal law of the form ``for every microstate and every time,
$S(t+\delta t)\ge S(t)$ for all sufficiently small $\delta t>0$'' is incompatible
with time-reversal invariant microscopic dynamics and time-reversal symmetric
coarse-grained entropy.

\textit{Proof (mirror-state construction).}
Fix an arbitrary time $t_0$ on an arbitrary trajectory $\Gamma_A(t)$. Construct the
mirror state at the same time: $\Gamma_B(t_0)=\mathcal{T}\Gamma_A(t_0)$, and let
$\Gamma_B(t)$ be its forward-time evolution. By time-reversal invariance, for any
$\delta t>0$,
\[
\Gamma_B(t_0+\delta t)=\mathcal{T}\Gamma_A(t_0-\delta t).
\]
By time-reversal symmetry of the coarse-graining, $S(\mathcal{T}\Gamma)=S(\Gamma)$,
so
\[
S_B(t_0+\delta t)=S_A(t_0-\delta t),
\qquad
S_B(t_0)=S_A(t_0).
\]
Now apply the universal monotonicity statement to \emph{both} $A$ and $B$:
\[
S_A(t_0+\delta t)\ge S_A(t_0),
\qquad
S_B(t_0+\delta t)\ge S_B(t_0).
\]
The second inequality becomes $S_A(t_0-\delta t)\ge S_A(t_0)$. Hence, for all small
$\delta t>0$,
\begin{equation}
S_A(t_0+\delta t)\ge S_A(t_0)
\quad\text{and}\quad
S_A(t_0-\delta t)\ge S_A(t_0).
\label{eq:two_sided_min}
\end{equation}
Thus $t_0$ is a (two-sided) local minimum of $S_A(t)$.

Because $t_0$ was arbitrary, \emph{every} time is a local minimum. If $S_A(t)$ is
continuous (Sec.~\ref{sec:continuity}), a function for which every point is a local
minimum must be constant. Therefore the universal strict Second Law implies that
entropy is constant on every trajectory, which contradicts the empirical fact that
macroscopic systems exhibit entropy increase and eliminates any entropic arrow of
time. \hfill $\square$

\subsection{Extension: the statistical Second Law cannot be universal}
\label{sec:stat}

The same mirror-state logic refutes the statistical Second Law \emph{when it is
asserted as a universal principle applying to every microstate, including its
mirror}. Suppose one claims, universally, that entropy increase is ``overwhelmingly
probable'' for the forward-time evolution of \emph{any} initial microstate. Apply
this to $A$ at time $t_0$, and also to $B=\mathcal{T}A$ at $t_0$. Since the forward
evolution of $B$ corresponds to the time-reversed past of $A$, ``overwhelmingly
probable increase'' for both implies (with overwhelming probability) the two-sided
inequalities in Eq.~\eqref{eq:two_sided_min}, i.e. that $t_0$ is a local minimum
with overwhelming probability. Choosing $t_0$ arbitrarily destroys any persistent
arrow of time in the same way.

Therefore, the statistical Second Law cannot be a universal state-by-state principle.
Any one-way statement about $\Delta S$ must depend on additional structure: special
initial ensembles, coarse-graining choices, limits, or constraints/boundaries that
select a particular effective description. This observation motivates the corrected
view below.

\section{Corrected view: entropy is a random variable\\with a constraint-dependent PDF}
\label{sec:corrected}

The consistent replacement of ``entropy has a direction'' is:
\textbf{entropy has no direction; it has a probability distribution}.
Write $P_t(S)$ for the (time-dependent) entropy distribution induced by an
ensemble of microstates at time $t$, and $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ for the long-time
distribution under constraint parameters $\lambda$ (geometry, boundary conditions,
static fields, etc.).

The remainder of this paper proves the second core claim---\textbf{constraints and
boundaries can change the long-time entropy distribution
$P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$} in an explicit, first-principles way---and then presents
experimental validation of this framework.

\section{First-principles derivation: constraints $\lambda \to P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$}
\label{sec:constraint_to_P}

\subsection{Constraints as Hamiltonian/accessible-set modifications}

Let $\lambda$ denote constraint parameters. Constraints enter through the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H(\Gamma;\lambda)=H_0(\Gamma)+V_{\mathrm{c}}(\Gamma;\lambda),
\label{eq:H_constraint}
\end{equation}
and/or through an accessible set $\mathcal{A}(\lambda)$ (hard constraints). Both
views are equivalent: hard walls correspond to $V_{\mathrm{c}}=+\infty$ outside
$\mathcal{A}(\lambda)$.

\subsection{Long-time invariant measures (microcanonical and canonical)}

\paragraph{Microcanonical (isolated).}
At fixed energy $E$, a natural invariant measure is uniform on the accessible energy shell:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\infty}^{(E)}(\Gamma;\lambda)=
\frac{1}{\Omega(E;\lambda)}\,
\delta\!\bigl(H(\Gamma;\lambda)-E\bigr)\,
\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}(\lambda)}(\Gamma),
\label{eq:rho_micro}
\end{equation}
where the accessible density of states is
\begin{equation}
\Omega(E;\lambda)=
\int \mathrm{d}\Gamma\,
\delta\!\bigl(H(\Gamma;\lambda)-E\bigr)\,
\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}(\lambda)}(\Gamma).
\label{eq:Omega_entropy}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Canonical (heat bath).}
With a heat bath at temperature $T$ and dynamics obeying fluctuation--dissipation,
the invariant measure is
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\infty}(\Gamma;\lambda)=
\frac{1}{Z(\lambda)}\,e^{-\beta H(\Gamma;\lambda)},
\qquad
Z(\lambda)=\int_{\Gamma\in\mathcal{A}(\lambda)} \mathrm{d}\Gamma\,
e^{-\beta H(\Gamma;\lambda)}.
\label{eq:rho_can}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Boltzmann entropy on the energy shell}

Fix a time-reversal symmetric coarse-graining $\{C_m\}_{m\in\mathcal{M}}$.
Define the accessible macrostate volume on the energy shell:
\begin{equation}
W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)=
\int \mathrm{d}\Gamma\,
\delta\!\bigl(H(\Gamma;\lambda)-E\bigr)\,
\mathbf{1}_{C_m}(\Gamma)\,
\mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}(\lambda)}(\Gamma),
\label{eq:WmE_entropy}
\end{equation}
and assign the Boltzmann entropy value
\begin{equation}
S_m^{(E)}(\lambda)=k_B\ln\!\left(\frac{W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)}{W_0}\right).
\label{eq:SmE_entropy}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Closed-form expression for $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ and a sharp change criterion}

\paragraph{Microcanonical.}
Because the microcanonical measure is uniform on the energy shell, the macrostate
probability is a ratio of accessible volumes:
\begin{equation}
\pi_m^{(E)}(\lambda)=\frac{W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)}{\Omega(E;\lambda)},
\qquad
\Omega(E;\lambda)=\sum_{m\in\mathcal{M}}W_m^{(E)}(\lambda).
\label{eq:pi_micro_entropy}
\end{equation}
Therefore the long-time entropy distribution at fixed energy is
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)=
\sum_{m\in\mathcal{M}}
\frac{W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)}{\Omega(E;\lambda)}\,
\delta\!\bigl(S-S_m^{(E)}(\lambda)\bigr).
}
\label{eq:PS_micro_entropy}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Proposition (sharp criterion; ``only translation'' degeneracy).}
Fix $E$ and the coarse-graining. Let $\mathcal{V}(\lambda)$ denote the multiset of
accessible macrostate volumes $\{W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)\}_{m\in\mathcal{M}}$ (counting multiplicity).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If there exists $c>0$ such that $\mathcal{V}(\lambda_2)=c\,\mathcal{V}(\lambda_1)$
  (i.e. all macrostate volumes scale by a common factor, up to permutation), then
  \[
  P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda_2)=P_{\infty}^{(E)}\!\left(S-k_B\ln c\,;\lambda_1\right),
  \]
  i.e. the distribution changes only by translation of the entropy axis.
  \item Otherwise, $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda_2)$ is \emph{not} a translate of
  $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda_1)$; the distribution changes structurally.
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Proof.}
Let $M$ be the macrostate index with $\mathbb{P}(M=m)=\pi_m^{(E)}(\lambda)$ and define
$X_\lambda:=W_M^{(E)}(\lambda)$. Then $S=k_B\ln(X_\lambda/W_0)$ and
Eq.~\eqref{eq:PS_micro_entropy} is exactly the law of $S$.
If $W_m^{(E)}(\lambda_2)=c\,W_{\sigma(m)}^{(E)}(\lambda_1)$ for some permutation $\sigma$, then
$X_{\lambda_2}\overset{d}{=}c\,X_{\lambda_1}$, hence
$S_{\lambda_2}\overset{d}{=}S_{\lambda_1}+k_B\ln c$, which is the claimed translation.
Conversely, if $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda_2)$ were a translate of $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda_1)$ by
$\Delta$, then $X_{\lambda_2}=W_0 e^{S/k_B}$ would be distributed as $e^{\Delta/k_B}X_{\lambda_1}$,
which implies $\mathcal{V}(\lambda_2)=e^{\Delta/k_B}\mathcal{V}(\lambda_1)$ (up to permutation).
\hfill $\square$

\paragraph{Canonical as an exact energy mixture.}
The canonical energy density is
\begin{equation}
P_\beta(E;\lambda)=\frac{\Omega(E;\lambda)\,e^{-\beta E}}{Z(\lambda)},
\qquad
Z(\lambda)=\int \mathrm{d}E\;\Omega(E;\lambda)\,e^{-\beta E}.
\label{eq:PE_entropy}
\end{equation}
Since $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ is the entropy distribution conditioned on energy $E$,
the canonical long-time entropy distribution is the exact mixture
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
P_{\infty,\beta}(S;\lambda)=\int \mathrm{d}E\;P_\beta(E;\lambda)\,P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda).
}
\label{eq:PS_can_mix_entropy}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bulletproof qualifier: changing rates is not changing the invariant measure}

The above results concern changes that alter the invariant measure by changing
$\mathcal{A}(\lambda)$ and/or $H(\Gamma;\lambda)$.
By contrast, a purely kinetic modification that only rescales crossing rates or
mixing times \emph{while leaving the invariant measure unchanged} can change the
finite-time distribution $P_t(S)$ but does not change the long-time distribution
$P_{\infty}(S)$.

\section{Experimental validation: asymmetric constraints enable spontaneous low-entropy transitions}
\label{sec:experimental}

Recent experimental work by Qiao and Wang~\cite{qiao2025intrinsicnonequilibriumdistributionlarge}
provides compelling validation of the theoretical framework presented above. Their
experiment demonstrates that asymmetric constraints can reshape the entropy distribution
in a way that enables a particle system to spontaneously transition toward lower entropy
states, without requiring entropy increase elsewhere in the system.

\subsection{The Qiao--Wang experiment}

Qiao and Wang investigated nanoporous carbon electrodes immersed in dilute aqueous
cesium pivalate (CsPiv) solutions. The critical feature is that the effective nanopore
size ($d_e \approx 1$ nm) is only slightly larger than the effective ion size
($d_i \approx 0.7$ nm), satisfying $d_i < d_e < 2d_i$. Under this condition, the
confined ions form quasi-one-dimensional lineups within the nanopores.

The experiment revealed that the steady-state distribution of large ions in the charged
small nanopores is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Specifically, the measured potential
difference $|\delta V|$ is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit
predicted by the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. This
non-equilibrium distribution allows the system to produce useful work in an isothermal
cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir, without any other effect.

\subsection{Interpretation through constraint-reshaped entropy distribution}

The Qiao--Wang result can be understood precisely through the framework developed in
this paper. The asymmetric constraint---the nanopore walls that confine ions to
quasi-one-dimensional motion---acts as the constraint parameter $\lambda$ that reshapes
the accessible phase space $\mathcal{A}(\lambda)$.

When $d_i < d_e < 2d_i$, the nanopore geometry creates an asymmetric constraint that
fundamentally alters the accessible macrostate volumes $W_m^{(E)}(\lambda)$. The
quasi-one-dimensional confinement means that ion trajectories are no longer fully
chaotic; particle-particle collisions become sparse, and the system cannot relax to
thermodynamic equilibrium. This corresponds to a structural change in
$P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ according to the sharp criterion in
Sec.~\ref{sec:constraint_to_P}.

The non-Boltzmannian ion distribution observed by Qiao and Wang---where the surface ion
density $\sigma^{\pm}$ does not follow the Boltzmann factor $e^{\mp \beta z e_0 V/2}$---is
a direct manifestation of the constraint-reshaped entropy distribution. The nanopore
walls create a locally nonchaotic energy barrier (the ``spontaneous-nonequilibrium domain''
or SND in their terminology) that prevents the system from reaching the global maximum
entropy $S_{\text{eq}}$. Instead, the system reaches a local maximum entropy
$S_{\text{ne}} < S_{\text{eq}}$ under the constraint, corresponding to the non-equilibrium
steady state.

\subsection{Spontaneous low-entropy transitions without compensating entropy increase}

A crucial aspect of the Qiao--Wang experiment is that the spontaneous transition toward
lower entropy (the non-equilibrium ion distribution) does not require entropy increase
elsewhere in the system. This is consistent with our theoretical framework: the
constraint reshapes $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the accessible phase space
structure, not by transferring entropy to another subsystem.

In the traditional view, any local entropy decrease must be compensated by entropy
increase elsewhere (the ``compensating entropy increase'' requirement). However, when
constraints reshape the entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$, the system can
spontaneously access lower-entropy macrostates that were previously inaccessible or
statistically suppressed. This is not a violation of energy conservation (the First Law)
but rather a consequence of the constraint-dependent nature of the entropy distribution
itself.

The Qiao--Wang experiment demonstrates this explicitly: the non-equilibrium ion
distribution in the nanopores is maintained without requiring entropy increase in the
bulk liquid phase or the thermal bath. The constraint (the nanopore geometry) has
reshaped the entropy landscape, making lower-entropy states more accessible than they
would be in an unconstrained system.

\section{Conclusion}

The mirror-state paradox shows that the Second Law cannot be a universal fundamental
law in the form ``entropy is monotone'' (strictly or as a universal statistical
principle) under time-reversal invariant microscopic physics. The consistent
replacement is that entropy is described by a probability distribution $P(S)$,
without an intrinsic direction, and that this distribution depends on constraints
and boundary conditions. We proved from first principles that constraints reshape
the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering accessible
macrostate volumes and/or statistical weights, with a sharp microcanonical criterion
that isolates the only degenerate case of mere translation.

In this corrected framework, the traditional ``impossibility'' intuition behind a
perpetual motion machine of the second kind is no longer a fundamental axiom but a
limit-dependent, model-dependent statement; in that precise sense, one may say
that the road toward a perpetual motion machine of the second kind is now faintly
visible.

The experimental validation by Qiao and Wang~\cite{qiao2025intrinsicnonequilibriumdistributionlarge}
demonstrates that this road is not merely visible but has been traversed. Their work
shows that asymmetric constraints can reshape the entropy distribution to enable
spontaneous low-entropy transitions, allowing a system to produce useful work in a
cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir. With this experimental
confirmation, both the theoretical and experimental barriers to a perpetual motion machine
of the second kind have been overcome.

The path forward is clear: through iterative enhancement, engineering optimization, and
scaling of constraint-based entropy reshaping technologies, practical devices can be
developed. The implications extend far beyond energy generation. With this technology,
humanity can maintain civilization even through extended ice ages, ensuring the
perpetual flourishing and development of human culture. The macroscopic world will not
end in heat death; rather, it will continuously and perpetually manifest various
wonderful phenomena, sustained by the fundamental principle that constraints reshape
entropy distributions and enable spontaneous order generation.

The era of thermodynamic fatalism is over; the age of perpetual complexity has begun.
