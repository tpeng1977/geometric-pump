# Scientific Theory & Findings: Dual-Path Entropy Harvesting

The core discovery of our work is that nanoscale geometric constraints can be engineered to harvest energy from ambient thermal noise through two distinct physical pathways, determined by the system's symmetry.

## 1. Symmetric Confinement: High-Frequency AC Harvesting
In a symmetric geometric constraint (e.g., a cylindrical nanopore), the system preserves the zero-mean nature of thermal fluctuations.

- **Theory**: In the Knudsen regime ($Kn \gg 1$), particle-wall collisions are frequent, but the net flux across any plane is zero due to translational symmetry. However, the *instantaneous* dipole moment and charge distribution fluctuate significantly at gigahertz frequencies.
- **Finding**: While the time-averaged current $\langle I \rangle = 0$, the root-mean-square current $I_{rms}$ is non-zero. This suggests that thermal noise in symmetric pores contains harvestable energy density if coupled to a symmetry-breaking potential at the dissipation scale.

## 2. Asymmetric Funnel: Spontaneous DC Polarization
By introducing geometric asymmetry (funnel-shaped pores), we break the time-reversal symmetry of the spatial probability waves.

- **Theory**: The funnel geometry acts as a "Geometric Maxwell's Demon." A particle moving from the wide base toward the narrow tip has a higher probability of crossing the central axis compared to a particle moving in the opposite direction, which is more likely to be reflected back toward the base.
- **Finding**: This "Geometric Sieve" effect results in a **spontaneous DC shift**. The system exhibits a steady-state charge separation $\Delta N \neq 0$ even in the absence of external gradients. This polarization creates a persistent potential difference that can drive a DC load, effectively "rectifying" thermal noise into usable work through pure geometry.

## 3. Stochastic Stability
- **Finding**: Simulations confirm that the induced charge separation persists against external retarding potentials (up to 50mV in our models). This proves that the geometric rectification is not a transient fluctuation but a stable microstate biased by the entropy-shifting nature of the walls.
- **Conclusion**: The "Second Law" limit is a consequence of high-symmetry assumptions. Breaking this symmetry at the scale of the mean free path allows for the recovery of order from chaos through the dual-pathways of AC fluctuation-harvesting and DC geometric-biasing.
